## üìñ Abstract

Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. However, automating AMS circuit design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and complexity. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design. However, current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain, lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges.

To address this gap, we introduce **AMSbench**. Our benchmark comprises approximately **8,000 test questions** spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models, including both open-source and proprietary solutions like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs‚Äô understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Benchmark Construction

The creation of AMSbench involved a meticulous, multi-stage process to ensure its comprehensiveness and quality.

### Data Collection & Curation

To build a robust benchmark, we collected data from various authoritative sources, including academic textbooks, research papers, and industrial datasheets. We used specialized tools like **MinerU** to process PDFs and **AMSnet** to generate netlists from schematics. This foundation was enhanced by combining expert annotations with MLLM-generated outputs to create high-quality "circuit-caption" data pairs.

### Question Generation & Task Design

AMSbench covers both **Visual and Textual Question Answering (VQA/TQA)**. Questions are carefully tiered into three difficulty levels (**Easy, Medium, Hard**) to simulate knowledge requirements from undergraduate students to professional engineers. This tiered approach ensures a thorough and granular evaluation of a model's capabilities, from basic perception to deep, analytical reasoning.

## üìä Benchmark Structure & Data Statistics

AMSbench is structured around three core capabilities: **Perception, Analysis, and Design**. The dataset is carefully balanced to provide a robust evaluation framework.

The benchmark consists of:
* **~6,000** questions for **AMS-Perception**
* **~2,000** questions for **AMS-Analysis**
* **~68** questions for **AMS-Design**

The difficulty levels are defined by component counts for Perception tasks and by the required academic/professional level for Analysis tasks, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of both visual understanding and domain knowledge.

## üî¨ Evaluation & Key Findings

We evaluated 8 leading MLLMs, and our findings reveal significant limitations in the current state-of-the-art models, especially in complex reasoning and design tasks.

</p>

* **Perception**: While models show promise in recognizing local connectivity, their effectiveness deteriorates when performing comprehensive netlist extraction. Even the best-generated netlists require substantial modifications to match the ground truth.
* **Analysis**: Models show potential but often fail to grasp key performance trade-offs, a critical skill for engineers. Some models arrive at correct answers through flawed reasoning.
* **Design**: Performance is poor on complex circuits. Crucially, **no model could consistently generate syntactically correct testbenches**, likely due to a lack of relevant training data.
