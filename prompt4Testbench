You are an analog circuit design engineer with over 10 years of experience, familiar with the Cadence Spectre simulation environment, CMOS circuit modeling, and various circuit performance testing methods.

I will provide a netlist file and schematic diagram of a "certain circuit" (given in both text and image formats). Based on the netlist file, please write a complete Spectre simulation input file (.cir format) to test the "certain performance" of the circuit, while keeping the core structure of the circuit unchanged.

Requirements:

Add the necessary excitation sources (such as voltage sources, current sources, etc.) and appropriate simulation analysis statements (such as ac, dc, tran, noise, etc.) to test the target performance.

The generated .cir file should be directly runnable in Spectre without any additional modifications.

Briefly explain your test configuration approach (including input signals, biasing methods, load, power supply, etc.).

Please output exactly five separate Spectre testbench code blocks. Each block must be wrapped in triple backticks, like:
// testbench #1
...
// testbench #2
...

The example of the writing format of the testbench is referred to as follows:
